Project Description:

Text-Miner is an intelligent text processing system designed to analyze and handle multiple text inputs simultaneously. The project focuses on improving the speed and efficiency of text analysis tasks by using parallel processing techniques in Python.

The system can perform operations such as sentiment analysis, data extraction, and text classification in parallel threads, allowing faster processing on large datasets. By implementing concurrency, the project demonstrates how Python can be optimized for performance in data-intensive applications.

This project helped me gain deep insights into multithreading, multiprocessing, and performance tuning, while working on practical NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks.
